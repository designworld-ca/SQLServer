Simple in theory, tricky in practice...available since SQL Server 2008 and often required by PCIS grade audits

These scripts show what to check and how to implement TDE at an enterprise level.  This is not intended to be applicable to
cloud environments like Azure.

All scripts tested on SQL Server 2016 Developer edition.
